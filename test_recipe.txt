Peel, seed, and chop the tomatoes. Place them in a large deep skillet or large pot along with the olive oil, spices, garlic, and herbs. Stir to combine.
Trim the stems from the eggplants and peel them. Some strips of skin can be left intact if you like a colorful zaalouk.
Finely chop the peeled eggplants and add them to the skillet or pot along with ¼ - ⅓ cup of water.
Cover and cook the tomato mixture and eggplants over medium heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chopped eggplant has begun to soften and reduce in volume. Stir to combine all the ingredients well.
Add the optional chili peppers or cayenne, if using, and a little more water if you found that the ingredients were sticking to the bottom of the pan. Cover and continue cooking for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until the eggplant and tomatoes are soft enough to mash. At this point, you can add the optional lemon juice, if using.
Continue cooking the zaalouk uncovered to reduce the liquids, scraping the bottom of the pan and stirring frequently. Adjust the heat if necessary to avoid burning the zaalouk. If you want a puree-like consistency, mash the eggplants and tomatoes while the liquids reduce. If you prefer a chunky texture, stir without mashing.
When the zaalouk has reduced to a consistency you like, taste and adjust seasoning then remove from the heat and serve with bread!
