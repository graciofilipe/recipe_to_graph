Ingredients:

Sourdough Starter:
* 1 1/4 cups rye flour
* 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
* 1 1/4 cups + 10 tbsp water (non-chlorinated, room temperature)

Flatbread Batter:
* 1 cup active sourdough starter (from above)
* 1 cup rye flour
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 2 cups water (non-chlorinated, room temperature)
* 1/2 tsp salt

Steps:

Sourdough Starter Creation (Days 1-5):
1. Day 1: Combine 1/4 cup rye flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp water in a clean glass jar. Mix until a thick paste forms. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature (70-75°F / 21-24°C) for 24 hours.
2. Day 2: Stir the mixture. Add 1/4 cup rye flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp water. Mix well. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours.
3. Day 3: Add 1/4 cup rye flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp water. Mix well. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours.
4. Day 4: Add 1/4 cup rye flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp water. Mix well. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours.
5. Day 5: Add 1/4 cup rye flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp water. Mix well. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours. If the starter has not doubled, repeat this step on Day 6.

Flatbread Batter Preparation (Day 5 or when starter is ready):
1. Combine the active sourdough starter, 1 cup rye flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 2 cups water in a large bowl. Whisk until a smooth, pancake-like batter forms.
2. Stir in the salt.
3. If the batter is too thick, add water, 1 tbsp at a time, until it is thin and pourable.
4. Cover the bowl loosely and let the batter ferment at room temperature for 4-12 hours, until bubbly.

Flatbread Cooking (Day 5/6):
1. Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
2. Pour 1/2 to 3/4 cup of batter onto the hot surface, spiraling outwards from the center to create a 10-12 inch circle.
3. Cook, undisturbed, for 2-3 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look dry. Do not flip.
4. Slide the cooked flatbread onto a clean cloth or plate. Cover with another cloth.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 with the remaining batter, stacking the cooked flatbreads and keeping them covered.
