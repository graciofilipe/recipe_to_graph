I want a 2 course meal. It's to celebrate international women's day and I'm doing this by using ingredients of 3 clours: green, purple and white.

Course 1: cubes of 3 colours: green, white and purple. Probably from Avocado, parsnip, and beetroot. 
Course 2: 3 ingredients of 3 colours: green, white and purple. Probably from spring greens, tofu, and purple cabbage - make sure not to cook the ingredients together so as not to mix the colours.
