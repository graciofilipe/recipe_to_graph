2 cups lukewarm water

1 ½ cups garbanzo flour

5 tablespoons olive oil, divided

1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt

½ teaspoon minced fresh rosemary (Optional)

freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions
Whisk together lukewarm water and garbanzo flour in a large bowl until smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a plate and let stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Skim off as much foam as possible from the top of batter. Whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil, kosher salt, and rosemary into batter until well combined.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).

Heat a 10-inch cast iron skillet over high heat until smoking hot. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil into the skillet and swirl to coat the bottom. Continue to heat until oil shimmers and a wisp of smoke rises from oil.

Quickly pour batter into hot oil; carefully transfer the skillet to the preheated oven.

Bake in the preheated oven until pancake is browned and crusty, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer pancake immediately to a plate and cut into wedges. Garnish with freshly ground black pepper and serve hot.
