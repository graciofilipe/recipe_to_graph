Ingredients:
1 Onion (chopped )

1 Carrot (cut in small cubes)

2 tbsp Olive oil

200 g Cavolo nero (leaves roughly chopped, stems finely chopped)

a pinch of chilli flakes (or to taste )

1 Can butter beans (drained )

600 ml Vegetable stock

Salt & pepper

Recipe:
Heat the olive oil in a deep, wide frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and garlic. Season with chilli flakes, salt and pepper, and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant.
Add the stock and beans to the pan. Bring to boil and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the veggies are tender.
Ladle half of the soup mixture into a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour back into the pan and add the cavolo nero.
Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the leaves and stems have softened. Enjoy!
