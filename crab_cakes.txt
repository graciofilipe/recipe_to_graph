Ingredients
30g unsalted butter, plus 60g for frying
2 tbsp olive oil, plus 4 tbsp for frying
1 small diced red onion
4 small diced celery stalks
1 small diced red pepper
1 small diced yellow pepper
5g minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
10g capers, drained
1/4 tsp hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco
1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 tsp crab boil seasoning, such as Old Bay
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
225g lump crabmeat, drained and picked to remove shells
50g plain dry bread crumbs
120g good mayonnaise
2 tsp Dijon mustard
2 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten

Method
1) Place the 30g butter, 2 tbsp oil, onion, celery, red and yellow peppers, parsley, capers, hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, crab boil seasoning, salt and pepper in a large saute pan over medium-low heat and cook until the vegetables are soft, approximately 15 to 20 mins. Cool to room temperature.
2) In a large bowl, break the lump crabmeat into small pieces and toss with the bread crumbs, mayonnaise, mustard and eggs. Add the cooked mixture and mix well. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 30 mins. Shape into bite-sized crab cakes.
3) Heat the remaining butter and olive oil for frying over medium heat in a large saute pan. Add the crab cakes and fry for 4 to 5 mins on each side, until browned. Drain on paper towels; keep them warm in a 140C/Gas mark 1 oven and serve hot.
