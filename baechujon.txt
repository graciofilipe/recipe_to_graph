Baechujeon
Ingredients
6-8 leaves napa cabbage use the inner leaves, not too small, not too big
For the batter
1 cup flour
1 cup water
1 egg
2 Tbsp potato starch
1 tsp salt
vegetable oil for frying
For dipping sauce
soy sauce
white vinegar
sesame seeds
gochugaru
Instructions
Separate the leaves from napa cabbage.
Pound the stem part of the cabbage so it straightens making it easier to be pan fried.
In a bowl, mix the flour and potato starch with cold water. If using, add the egg and a tsp of salt. Stir until the batter is smooth and slightly runny. If it’s too thick, add a little more water.
Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add a little cooking oil. Dip each cabbage leaf into the batter, making sure both sides are well-coated.
Place the battered cabbage leaves in the frying pan. Don’t overcrowd the pan; fry in batches if necessary. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the pancakes are golden brown and crispy.
While the pancakes are frying, mix the soy sauce, vinegar, and gochugaru and sesame seeds (all to taste) in a small bowl.
Serve warm with the dipping sauce on the side. You can cut it to bite size pieces with scissors before serving.
